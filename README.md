# API-Merchant-Hosted
Merchant Hosted is a service where data input is native to the merchant’s website, without having to redirect to a DOKU-hosted page. Having the payment form on the merchant page does not compromise the security of the cardholder however, none of the cardholder data will actually be stored on the merchant’s server.
